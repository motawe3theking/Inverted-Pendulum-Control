This project implements a **Pole Placement Controller** to stabilize an inverted pendulum using state feedback control techniques. In addition to state feedback, an observer is designed to estimate unmeasured states for improved robustness and control performance. Developed in **MATLAB/Simulink**, this project demonstrates advanced control system design, simulation, and verification. The project was part of my course work for the advanced control course in university, so it serves as proof that I understood the concepts mentioned in this README...

The inverted pendulum is an inherently unstable system that must be actively balanced by controlling the cartâ€™s horizontal movement. Our controller uses pole placement to set the closed-loop system poles at desired locations, ensuring stability and quick response, while the observer helps to reconstruct any missing state information. The model of this dynamic system was simplified for educational purposes.

## How It Works
This project consists of 3 parts:
- **Task 1:** Validated the pole placement controller design assuming that all the states are measurable and available for feedback. All initial values are zeros and the set point is 1.
- **Task 2:** Same as task 1, but with a non zero initial value and a zero set point.
- **Task 3:** Same as task 1, but using the assumption that only x is measurable and available for feedback. for such scenario, we used a reduced-order state-observer.
  
The project combines a state feedback controller with an observer:
- **State Feedback Control:** Uses the full state information (or estimated states) to compute the control input that stabilizes the system.
- **Observer Design:** Estimates the states that are not directly measured, enhancing control accuracy and robustness.
- **Pole Placement:** The desired poles are chosen to achieve fast settling time and minimal overshoot.
- **Integral Action:** Included to eliminate steady-state error.
