This project implements a **Pole Placement Controller** to stabilize an inverted pendulum using state feedback control techniques. In addition to state feedback, an observer is designed to estimate unmeasured states for improved robustness and control performance. Developed in **MATLAB/Simulink**, this project demonstrates advanced control system design, simulation, and verification.

The inverted pendulum is an inherently unstable system that must be actively balanced by controlling the cartâ€™s horizontal movement. Our controller uses pole placement to set the closed-loop system poles at desired locations, ensuring stability and quick response, while the observer helps to reconstruct any missing state information.

## How It Works

The project combines a state feedback controller with an observer:
- **State Feedback Control:** Uses the full state information (or estimated states) to compute the control input that stabilizes the system.
- **Observer Design:** Estimates the states that are not directly measured, enhancing control accuracy and robustness.
- **Pole Placement:** The desired poles are chosen to achieve fast settling time and minimal overshoot.
- **Integral Action:** Included to eliminate steady-state error.
